# Time evolution


Time evolution with PauliStrings.jl is done in the Heisenberg picture because pure states are rank 1 density matrices and low rank density matrices cannot be efficiently encoded as a sum of Pauli strings ([Loizeau 2024](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2308006120)).


The advantage of working with Pauli strings is that noisy systems can be efficiently simulated in this representation ([Schuster 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12768)). Depolarizing noise makes long strings decay, so we can make the simulations tractable by combining noise with truncation.


Let's time evolve operator $Z_1$ in the chaotic spin chain
```math
H = \sum_i X_i X_{i+1}-1.05 Z_i +h_X X_i.
```
First we construct the Hamiltonian:

```julia
using PauliStrings
import PauliStrings as ps
```

```julia
function chaotic_chain(N::Int)
    H = ps.Operator(N)
    # XX interactions
    for j in 1:(N - 1)
        H += "X",j,"X",j+1
    end
    H += "X",1,"X",N # close the chain
    # fields
    for j in 1:N
        H += -1.05,"Z",j
        H += 0.5,"X",j
    end
    return H
end
```
We initialize a Hamiltonian and the $Z_1$ operator on a 32 spins system.

```julia
N = 32 # system size
H = chaotic_chain(N) # Hamiltonian
O = ps.Operator(N) # operator to time evolve
O += "Z", 1 # Z on site 1
```

Now we write a function that will time evolve operator O under Hamiltonian H and return some observable. Here we are interested in recording the correlator
```math
S(t) = \frac{1}{2^N} \text{Tr} [Z_1(t)Z_1(0)].
```
We will time evolve O by integrating Von Neuman's equation $i \frac{dO}{dt}=-[H,O]$ with Runge-Kutta ([`rk4`](@ref)). At each time step we do 3 things :

1. Perform a [`rk4`](@ref) step
2. [`add_noise`](@ref) that makes long strings decay
3. [`trim`](@ref) O by keeping only M strings with the largest weight

```julia
# heisenberg evolution of the operator O using rk4
# return tr(O(0)*O(t))/tr(O(t)^2)
# M is the number of strings to keep at each step
# noise is the amplitude of depolarizing noise
using ProgressBars

function evolve(H, O, M, times, noise)
    echo = []
    O0 = deepcopy(O)
    dt = times[2]-times[1]
    for t in ProgressBar(times)
        push!(echo, ps.trace(O*ps.dagger(O0))/ps.trace(O0*O0))
        # perform one step of rk4, keep only M strings, do not discard O0
        O = ps.rk4(H, O, dt; heisenberg=true, M=M,  keep=O0)
        # add depolarizing oise
        O = ps.add_noise(O, noise*dt)
        # keep the M strings with the largest weight. Do not discard O0
        O = ps.trim(O, M; keep=O0)
    end
    return real.(echo)
end
```

Now we can actually time evolve O for different trim values and plot the result:

```julia
# time evolve O for different trim values
times = range(0, stop=5, step=0.05)
noise = 0.01
for trim in (10,12,14)
    S = evolve(H, O, 2^trim, times, noise)
    loglog(times, S) #plot S(t)
end
