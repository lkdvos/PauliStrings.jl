    equivalence_class(A1::Operator, H::Operator)

Equivalence class of A1 with respect to Hamiltonian H, as defined in [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13026) Algorithm 1.
The equivalence class is returned as an operator with coeficients 1
Use [`get_pauli`](@ref) to access individual strings.
